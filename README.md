# octra_ref_client
a fast python TUI client for prototyping and references for octra network, with full HFHE (PVAC ver.) support out of the box (will include test variations and demo examples for quick feature exploration)

to build and run, you will need a precompiled pvac-hfhe library with support for SIMD instructions (will come right here with specific rules for assembly and testing)

## pvac-hfhe (setup, build and run)

## creating a wallet for octra

## tui client (run and use)
